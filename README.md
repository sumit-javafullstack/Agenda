# AgendaJavaFullStack

# 1) GIT ( resolve conflict )
# 2) Java 8 features with coding
# 3) ENUM in java
# 3) SpringBoot CRUD with below features
        a) Use lombok
        b) JPA and Hibernate properties
        c) PUT along with exception handling
        d) Global Exceptional handling
        e) Use of spring validation dependency 
        f) Cacheing
        g) Pagenation for efficient way of searching and filtering
        h ) File upload and access //https://www.bezkoder.com/spring-boot-upload-file-database/
# 3.1) Migrate a springboot application from http to https
# 4) Unit Testing and Integration Testing using mockito
# 5) Kafka with below features:
      a) Publish-Subscribe Messaging:
      Utilize Kafka's publish-subscribe model to enable multiple consumers to subscribe to the same topic and receive copies of messages.
      b )Message Serialization:
      Configure message serialization and deserialization to convert complex data structures to and from the byte streams that Kafka uses for communication.
      c) Message Partitioning:
      Use partitioning to distribute messages across multiple brokers for scalability and parallel processing. Implement custom partitioners if needed.
      d) Consumer Groups:
      Utilize consumer groups to scale horizontally and distribute message processing workload across multiple instances of a consumer within the same consumer group.
      e) Offset Management:
      Handle offset management to keep track of the position of the last consumed message in each partition. This ensures that consumers can resume from where they left off.
      f) Dead Letter Queues:
      Implement dead letter queues or error-handling mechanisms for messages that couldn't be successfully processed by consumers.
      g) Streams API:
      Leverage Kafka Streams to build event-driven applications that can process and transform streams of data in real-time.
      i) Batch Processing:
      Use Kafka for batch processing scenarios by consuming messages from topics that store batches of data.
